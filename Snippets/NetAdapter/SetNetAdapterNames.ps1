Problem:
When adding multiple NIC's to a VM, there is no telling how Windows enumerates them,
and thus setting names may prove difficult.

Solution:
It does seem that we can take for granted, that the first NIC added to a Hyper-V VM, will
have the lowest mac address, the 2nd NIC will have the 2nd lowest, and so forth.

This snippet use the script resource to rename NIC's ordered by their mac addresses, giving
the first name in the config, to the NIC with the lowest mac address, and so forth.

If you know a better way to handle this, please submit a pull request :-)

Test Setup:
Windows Server 2016 Standard Evaluation
Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSVersion                      5.1.14393.0
PSEdition                      Desktop
PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}
BuildVersion                   10.0.14393.0
CLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000
WSManStackVersion              3.0
PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1

Scenario:
A Hyper-V VM with two NIC's has been configured.
1st NIC is connected to an internal switch.
2nd NIC is connected to an external switch.
We want the name of the NIC's to reflect this.
